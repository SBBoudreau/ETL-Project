Datasets: house pricing per zip code

Our final database merges historical values with projected percentage change per zip code for the state of Texas.  
With this combined dataset, we will be able to see projected listing prices by zip code--which was initially only available in the Zillow dataset.  
 
Our final database will be relational (Postgres) because of the pre-defined housing zip codes provided in both datasets.
